# HTML5-CSS3-JAVASCRIPT
Taken with Dr. Ethel Schuster at NECC


All six files contained in this repository make up my final project in web development. 
This is by far my favorite piece of work done so far. The assignment was to create a 
fully functioning site using a combination of HTML5, CSS3, and JAVASCRIPT. My good friend
and master plumber had no web presence at all. I interviewed him about what he would like 
to showcase, his company colors, and collected many pictures of his projects. This is the
result. A zip file containing the actual pictures is available upon request.


CSS

The CSS page creates a cascade style effect that adds attributes like color,
fonts, margins, and events like changing the color of hyperlinks when hovered.
It also adds my favorite feature which configures the screen to the size of the
device and when it detects the ability to dial such as on a mobile phone or a
device configured with Skype it will become active allowing one touch dialing
on any touchscreen.


INDEX

This is the home page with company information, license number, and a series of 
pictures set to infinitely cycle using a scripted for loop that displays his finest 
work and services.


ABOUT

This page gives background on the business and some of the specialized projects
that set him apart. It also contains a family style photo with a caption written
by me, that attempts to sum up what he stands for as a master tradesman based
on our interviews, "I never turn down contracts for complexity. When other plumbers
are unable or unwilling to satisfy your requirements don't sacrifice, call KJ Gray"


SPECIAL PROJECTS

This page was written as per the requirements of the instructions for my final with
a series of thumbnail pictures, that when selected become enlarged and a caption is added.


RECOMMENDED RETAILERS

This page was created as a directory for clients to easily access the supply houses
he holds accounts with. The hyperlink takes clients directly to their site where they
can shop online for fixtures, choosing styles and colors, they are then picked up and 
installed minimizing any confusion about availability.


CONTACT

This page provides direct access to his email using a form which 
catorgorizes the nature of the issue and creates an alert wich is 
sent directly to his email. There are also hyperlinks to his email
at the bottom of each page in the footer section for user convenience.
